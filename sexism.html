                    Rep. Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez Takes on Sexism in Politics
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After engaging in a political disagreement with Rep. Ted Yoho, he reportedly said she was a "fucking bitch" as she walked away. Instead of leaving this sexist interaction be, Rep. Ocasio-Cortez used this atrocious situation to set an example for men and women alike.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    In Rep. Yoho's apology, Rep. Ocasio-Cortez highlighted the need to put an end to the famous trope used by men: the "fathers of daughters" excuse. In Yoho's apology he used this excuse to defend against any allegations of sexism. However, simply being a father of a woman does not discount you from sexist remarks. And if anything, it should force you to take more responsibility when it comes to setting an example for other men and how they treat women.

                <h2>
                    "We're Getting Your Husbands Back to Work" - Trump
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At a recent rally, President Trump asked for the support of suburban women, arguing that he was helped them by getting their husbands back to work.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    This sexist notion is one that isn't new, but is surely outdated. Many women today do not rely on their husbands for income, yet Trump's comment looks as though it should be living in 1950. The stereotypical suburban housewife image Trump attempted to create only left us with one impression: disgust.

                <p>
                    A major concern about the Covid-19 pandemic is the potential setback of gender equality. As of now, women make up 39% of global employment but account for 54% of overall job losses since May 2020. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Additionally, with children at home for online schooling, the burden of unpaid care has disproportionately fallen on women. This is a definite step back for cultural and societal progress, but here's to hoping 2021 will bring about more change.
